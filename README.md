# Introduction
This project consists of a collection of FizzBuzz programs in various programming languages, with the intention to continue adding to it as I learn new programming languages. 

This project is inspired by a YouTube video of Tom Scott ["FizzBuzz: One Simple Interview Question"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc), in which he discusses the importance of writing readable and scalable code. Thus, I aims to improve my coding skills in a clean and organized manner through this project by recording my initial attempt, along with better solutions contributed by others, and my updated solutions.

# What is FizzBuzz?

According to ChatGPT:

FizzBuzz is a simple programming problem that is often used as an interview question for entry-level programming jobs. The problem requires the programmer to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, with the following exceptions:

- If the number is divisible by 3, the program should print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by 5, the program should print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the program should print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

The goal of the FizzBuzz problem is to test the programmer's ability to write clean, concise, and efficient code to solve a simple problem. It also helps to demonstrate their understanding of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic operators.
